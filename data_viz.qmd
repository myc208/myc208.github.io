## Micron SSD Defect Data Visualization

During my internship at **Micron Technology**, I completed visualizations for inspection machines, helping to identify defect patterns in SSD manufacturing.

### The Visualization Task
The goal was to allow better conceptualization of defect data through graphical representations. I used **Tableau** and **Python** to create interactive dashboards that communicated insights effectively to engineers and managers globally.

### Story & Rationale
We needed to move beyond raw data logs to understand *when* and *where* defects were occurring.
-   **Temporal Patterns:** I used line and area charts to show defect trends over time.
-   **Composition:** Pie and stacked bar charts were used to show the breakdown of defect types.
-   **Distribution:** Histograms helped visualize the distribution of defect occurrences across different manufacturing sites.

### Result
The visualizations allowed for quicker identification of machine faults, saving the company approximately **~$250k monthly** on software subscriptions by consolidating analysis tools.

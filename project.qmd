title: "Project: IoT Plant Watering System"
---

## Overview
This group project developed a smart plant irrigation system using Raspberry Pi and sensors to automate watering based on soil moisture levels. It features a 3D-printed water dispensing tube, a mini motor for valve control, and a web dashboard for remote access.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Hardware Sensors/Servo, 3D Printed Parts
- **Software:** Python, MQTT, SQLite
- **Database:** SQLite for logging moisture and valve states

## Key Features
1.  **Moisture Monitoring:** Real-time soil moisture readings via sensor trigger automatic watering.
2.  **Water Level Detection:** Alerts when the reservoir is low.
3.  **Manual Override:** Remote control to open/close valves via a web dashboard.
4.  **MQTT Integration:** Publishes sensor data and receives control commands seamlessly.

## Key Learnings
- **Hardware-Software Integration:** Interfaced sensors and actuators with Raspberry Pi for real-time control.
- **IoT Scalability:** Designed a system that is small yet expandable using MQTT for remote monitoring.

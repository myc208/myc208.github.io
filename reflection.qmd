title: "Reflection on the use of GenAI"
---

## Experience Summary
For this assessment, I utilized Generative AI tools like **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** to assist in the development of my assessment portfolio website.

## How GenAI Helped
1.  **Code Structure:** I used GenAI to generate a summary of the portfolio for this assessment from my original portfolio that has already been coded out but in a different file format.
2.  **Debugging:** When facing any issues with adding images, I used Google Gemini to help me in suggesting ideas and solutions to fix it.
3.  **Content Refinement:** GenAI helped refine my project descriptions to be more punchy and professional, ensuring every section of this assessment were concise.

## Benefits
* **Efficiency:** It significantly sped up the coding process, allowing me to focus on the design and content rather than syntax errors.
* **Learning Aid:** It acted as a tutor, explaining *why* certain CSS properties worked better for my specific layout needs.

## Challenges
* **Context Awareness:** The AI sometimes provided generic code that didn't fit my specific file structure, requiring me to manually adjust paths and class names.
* **Over-reliance:** There is a temptation to copy-paste without fully understanding the underlying logic, which I had to actively mitigate by reviewing every line of suggested code.

## Future Application
I see GenAI as a "force multiplier" for my future career in Fintech. It will allow me to prototype applications faster and write unit tests more comprehensively, but the core architectural decisions will still rely on my own domain knowledge.
